# Level of Evidance Dataset

This repo contains the Level of Evidence (LoE) classification dataset for medical publications as described in the paper: "Supporting Evidence-Based Medicine by Finding Both Relevant and Significant Works".


In evidence-based medicine, the LoE framework categorizes medical publications into distinct levels based on the strength and reliability of the empirical evidence they provide. This repository includes a dataset of medical publications classified by their LoE.

The LoE framework is critical for assessing the significance of medical research, particularly when filtering relevant studies in information retrieval (IR) systems. This repository offers resources to replicate the automated LoE classification.
